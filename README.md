# MyFirstTextBasedRpgGame
My first text-based RPG on a C# Console App

Before you launch it:

If you are on windows, modify in Program.cs the route to gameBackground.wav or delete it.
If you are on other OS, just delete SoundPlayer from Main in Program.cs

Then you can build app in your compiler and play. Enjoy

(this is a small project, so dont hope it to be a masterpiece, but I put a part of my soul into it though)
